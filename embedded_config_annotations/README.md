# embedded_config_annotations

This package contains annotations for configuring code generation for the [embedded_config](https://pub.dev/packages/embedded_config) package.

The embedded_config package allows application configurations to be embedded directly into source code at build-time, aiming to solve the problem of needing different configurations per environment. Please see its [README](https://pub.dev/packages/embedded_config) for more information.
